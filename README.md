Data Mining Project using Python for Market Basket Optimization and Clustering Methods. 
Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is a widely used technique in data mining that helps uncover associations between products based on transaction data. This technique is particularly valuable for retail businesses, e-commerce platforms, and supermarkets, enabling them to optimize product placements, cross-sell strategies, and promotional offers. This project leverages the Apriori algorithm, a popular association rule mining technique, to identify frequent itemsets and generate meaningful association rules. By analyzing transaction datasets, we extract insights into product affinities, helping businesses make strategic recommendations that enhance sales and improve customer satisfaction. The Apriori algorithm works by iteratively identifying frequent item combinations and deriving association rules such as “If a customer buys product A, they are likely to buy product B”, thereby supporting informed decision-making in marketing and inventory management.

Clustering is a fundamental unsupervised learning technique used in data mining and machine learning to group similar data points based on their characteristics. It is widely applied across various domains, including customer segmentation, anomaly detection, image segmentation, and pattern recognition. By identifying inherent structures within datasets, clustering enables businesses and researchers to uncover hidden patterns and make data-driven decisions.
